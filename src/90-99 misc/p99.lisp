;; The framework of a crossword puzzle is represented internally as a graph, with nodes representing sites, storing 
;;   the coordinates of the starting point, direction and length and (if defined) the contents of the site, and edges 
;;   representing the points at which sites intersect.
;; A site is a list of 4 elements: its starting coordinates, direction (either (cons 1 0) or (cons 0 1)), length and word.
;; An edge has as its weight a dotted pair representing its coordinates.

;; An example string representation of a puzzle is as follows:
;;   ......  .
;;   . .  .  .
;;   . ..... .
;;   . . . ...
;;     . ... .
;;    ...
